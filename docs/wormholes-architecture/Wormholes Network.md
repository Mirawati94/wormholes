# Wormholes Network

  The Wormholes Blockchain Network is composed of multiple levels, consisting of the Transport Level, Blockchain Level, API Level, and Application Level. 
  The Transport Level is for making efficient use of network connectivity. The Blockchain Level makes decentralization a reality and lays the foundation 
  for the token economics that are inherent in most real blockchain-related projects. The Blockchain Level provides the token economics and provides the 
  mechanism for and keeps track of the messages passing between nodes. The API Level is a programming abstraction separate from the lower levels and the 
  Application Level. The Application Level is a placeholder for all applications.
